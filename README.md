## How to Use the CLI Script

You can also run Scholar Seek as a command-line tool directly from your terminal.

**Basic search:**

```bash
python main.py "cancer immunotherapy"
```

This will display an overview of the top 10 most relevant articles for the search term.

**Specify number of results:**

```bash
python main.py "cancer immunotherapy" -n 5
```

This returns only the top 5 results.

**Choose output mode:**

```bash
python main.py "cancer immunotherapy" -m emails
```

`-m` or `--mode` can be one of the available application output options (e.g., `relevance`, `pub_date`, `Author`, `JournalName`).

**Sort results:**

```bash
python main.py "cancer immunotherapy" -s date
```

Sort articles by relevance, date, or other supported PubMed sort options.


```bash
python main.py "cancer immunotherapy" -e example@email.com
```

Search and display articles associated with a specific author email.

**Combine options:**

```bash
python main.py "cancer immunotherapy" -n 5 -m emails -s date
```

You can mix and match options to customize your search results.
