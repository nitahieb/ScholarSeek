## 1. Create a Pull Request (PR)
- Create a branch for your work (e.g., `feature/xyz` or `fix/abc`).
- Open a pull request targeting the **`main`** branch.

## 2. Automated Checks Must Pass
- Ensure your changes pass **all checks**, including:
  - Code formatting and linting
  - Unit and integration tests
  - Continuous Integration (CI) builds
- PRs **cannot be merged** until these checks are successful and marked as complete.

## 3. Approval Needed
- At least **one reviewer's approval** is required to merge your PR.
- You may merge once approved

## 4. Merge the PR
- After successful checks and approval, go ahead and merge the PR.
- If using a feature branch, you may delete it after merging if desired.
